Favorite Labs 

Lab 1: Lab 1 was my favorite because i was introudice to C++ coding. Not only was it hard at first but now seems really easy. This was the alloed the fundamental to clone repositaries and how to use the "ls" or "cd".


Lab 7: Lab 7 was about parking streets. Whether a car can park from a certain day and time period. we had to code to figure out wether the car is able to park in the space. It would give us examples like what car can park while the day is Saturday for 7am-1pm


Lab 11: We had to look at states figure out land area and population. We had to do this while using calucualtion to figure out the number of land area to population.
